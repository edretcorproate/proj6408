# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project was all about using css-layouts to achieve the results described by the teacher.
Everything was actually surprisingly easier to understand than trying to mess with the css
yourself. I enjoyed the project.

Compile: Not needed
Running: Live Preview on Visual studio code, or dragging index to browser.
